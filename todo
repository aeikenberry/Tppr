1. Loading all the levels on startup is probably not a good idea.
  - Load next level only if they successfully cleared previous level.
  - Keep track of current level so we can clear all levels and then load a specific one if needed.

2. In Tapper, when you serve someone a beer, they are pushed back, and then there is a drinking period where they do not move forward and beers go past them.
  - In the current implementation, they start moving right away.

3. In Tapper, there is a fixed number of patrons per row. Say there are 4 starting ones, there can never be more than 4 on that lane.
  - In the current implementation, it always starts with 1 and just increments endlessly based on a level attribute.

4. The winning logic is wrong. There shouldn't be get 10 out the door,
    it's get all the starting ones out the door at the same time. There shouldn't be new ones made
    constantly, which should also help with performance.
  - don't remove the puck if it gets knocked all the way back, just wait to see if it gets re-added
