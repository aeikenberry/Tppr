1. Loading all the levels on startup is probably not a good idea.
  - Load next level only if they successfully cleared previous level.
  - Keep track of current level so we can clear all levels and then load a specific one if needed.

2. In Tapper, when you serve someone a beer, they are pushed back, and then there is a drinking period where they do not move forward and beers go past them.
  - In the current implementation, they start moving right away.

3. In Tapper, there is a fixed number of patrons per row. Say there are 4 starting ones, there can never be more than 4 on that lane.
  - In the current implementation, it always starts with 1 and just increments endlessly based on a level attribute.
